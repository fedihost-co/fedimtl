  the photo should turn primary red at the same time as the card hovers and then
  return back to the primary-contrast as well
- [x] Make the embeded map sit on a primary-contrast colored box. Change the
  color of the "View Larger Map" link to --white and make it bold and centered

  primary-contrast stroke around the whole box. Remove the 1px solid black
  border on the iframe.
